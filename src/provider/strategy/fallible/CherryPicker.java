/**
 * Reversi strategy that focuses on passing the current turn to end the game if the score is higher
 * than the opponent's score. By forcing the game to end while the current player has the highest
 * score, the current player is guaranteed to win.
 *
 * <p>It's important to note that this strategy operates under the assumption that the game will
 * end after a certain number of consecutive passes take place, and the winner of the game is
 * determined solely by the highest score. It also assumes that passing will not directly affect
 * the current player's score.</p>
 *
 * <p>The name of this strategy, "Cherry Picker", is a sports term that refers to when a player
 * waits near the goal until an opportunity to score easy points arrives in front of the player.
 * Similarly, this strategy only acts if an easy and immediate win is explicitly available - hence
 * the name, "Cherry Picker".</p>
